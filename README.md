Supports any Arduino board.

The program uses a simple algorithm which I learned from some Python book.

1. Check if the AI can win in one move.
2. Check if the player can win in one move.
3. Choose an empty corner.
4. Choose an empty side.
5. Choose the center.

Sorry for my poor English. If you find any wrong English grammer, open an issue.
