This program uses 54 KB of the Arduino's Flash and more than 6 KB of the SRAM, so it can only run on:

* Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3
* Arduino Uno R4
* Arduino Zero
* Arduino Due
* Arduino GIGA R1 WiFi
* Arduino MKR family
* Arduino Nano 33 IoT
* Arduino Nano R4
* Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect
* Arduino Nano ESP32
* Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense
* Arduino Nano 33 BLE
* Arduino Portenta family
* Arduino Nicla family
* ESP32 boards
* RP2040 boards

The program uses a simple algorithm which I learned from some Python book.

1. Check if the AI can win in one move.
2. Check if the player can win in one move.
3. Choose an empty corner.
4. Choose an empty side.
5. Choose the center.

Sorry for my poor English. If you find any wrong English grammer, open an issue.
